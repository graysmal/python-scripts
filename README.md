# python-scripts
 
## ABOUT

Currently only contains a few python scripts that I use daily and seem to need to share with others often.  
Will probably end up just being filled with miscellaneous python scripts that I deem cleaned up *enough* to post.

## REQUIREMENTS

**MUST** add [FFMPEG.exe](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) and [MediaInfo.exe](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) into an environment variable path.  
i recommend making a folder on the root C: drive called tools and dropping them in there.

## SCRIPTS
**change_container** - as losslessly as possible converts a files type into another file type.  
**change_containers** - will run change_container with set variables for every media file in the directory.  
**comp-video-script** - prompts for a Mb value to compress a video file down to. opts for removal of audio tracks as well.  
**comment-tag-writer** - will duplicate file "comment" tags on media files to other media files that share the same name. kind of a weird script.
